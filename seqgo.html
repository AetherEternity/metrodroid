            <h1>Metrodroid: Go Card (South East Queensland, AU)</h1>
            
            <p>Go Card is the public transport smartcard used in South East Queensland, Australia.  This includes Brisbane, Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast.</p>
            
            <p>These cards use a Mifare Classic 1K card, and have unique encryption keys.  You need a phone which supports Mifare Classic (see Metrodroid's about screen), and the encryption keys for your card.  This means <a href="https://github.com/micolous/metrodroid/wiki/Cracking-keys">you need to crack your card's keys</a>, which is possible for some (but not all) cards.</p>
            
            <p>Metrodroid <em>only reads data on your card</em>, and does not require that you register your Go card or use online services.  It implements enough of the card format to be able to read your balance and recent trips.</p>
            
            <p>Metrodroid cannot write to your Go card, and does not allow your phone to emulate a Go card.</p>
            
            <h2>Known issues</h2>
            
            <p>There are a number of caveats with Go card support:</p>
            
            <h3>Special cards not supported (Go Access, Explore, SEEQ)</h3>
            
            <p>These special cards are untested and may not work with Metrodroid.</p>
            
            <h3>Not all stops known</h3>
            
            <p>Metrodroid has a small stop database.  Once you have cracked your card's keys, you can contribute additional stop IDs from the app.</p>
            
            <p>Newer versions of Metrodroid have more stops.  All fare information can be read from v2.9.29 and later.</p>
