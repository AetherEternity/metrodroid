            <h1>Metrodroid: Go Card (South East Queensland, AU)</h1>
            
            <p>Go Card is the public transport smartcard used in South East Queensland, Australia.  This includes Brisbane, Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast.</p>
            
            <p>These cards use a Mifare Classic 1K card, and have unique encryption keys.  You need a phone which supports Mifare Classic (see Metrodroid's about screen), and the encryption keys for your card.  This means <a href="https://github.com/micolous/metrodroid/wiki/Cracking-keys">you need to crack your card's keys</a>, which is possible for some (but not all) cards.</p>
            
            <p>Metrodroid <em>only reads data on your card</em>, and does not require that you register your Go card or use online services.  It implements enough of the card format to be able to read your balance and recent trips.</p>
            
            <p>Metrodroid cannot write to your Go card, and does not allow your phone to emulate a Go card.</p>
            
            <h2>Known issues</h2>
            
            <p>There are a number of caveats with Go card support:</p>
            
            <h3>Special cards not supported (Go Access, Explore, SEEQ)</h3>
            
            <p>These special cards are untested and may not work with Metrodroid.</p>
            
            <h3>Not all stops known</h3>
            
            <p>Metrodroid has a small stop database.  Once you have cracked your card's keys, you can contribute additional stop IDs from the app.</p>
            
            <p>Newer versions of Metrodroid have more stops.  All fare information can be read from v2.9.29 and later.</p>

            <h3>Single trip shown as two distinct trips</h3>

            <p>This is normally because of data on the card -- there is a "journey ID", there is a continuation flag, and these aren't always stored in a useful way.</p>

            <p>In cases where your fare exceeds the <a href="https://translink.com.au/tickets-and-fares/fares-and-zones/fixed-fare">default fare for that mode</a> (eg: train trips of 5 or more zones, or trips <em>to</em> an Airtrain station from a non-Airtrain station), you may see a charge listed for the default fare, and then a second charge for the difference between your final fare and your default fare.</p>

            <h3>Last trip shown with one station and a negative amount</h3>

            <p>Only the last 12 touch events are stored. If a trip is in progress, or a default fare was applied to your card, then you might see a negative amount with a single station or stop (where you tapped off) in the last slot.  This will be for the difference between the <a href="https://translink.com.au/tickets-and-fares/fares-and-zones/fixed-fare">default fare for that mode</a> and your final fare.</p>

				<h3>Negative balances not shown</h3>
				
				<p>This is fixed in Metrodroid 2.9.32.</p>
