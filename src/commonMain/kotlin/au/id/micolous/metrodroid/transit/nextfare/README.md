# Cubic Nextfare

This implements some base fare reader capability for Cubic Nextfare on MIFARE Classic.

This is used by Go card (South East Queensland) and Transit Access Pass (Los Angeles).

This defaults to a fare system where the currency is represented in dollars. Individual systems should subclass some parts of this.  For an example, see Go card (`seq_go` package).
