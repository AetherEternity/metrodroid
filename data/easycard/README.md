Upstream data sources are in `stationlist/`.

* `lines.csv`: Line names manually entered from Wikipedia.

* `stations.csv`: Station list. Created from a union of the upstream data source (in `stationlist/`) and [EasyDump.sh](http://www.fuzzysecurity.com/scripts/15.html).

TODO: Add OSM data here once it has correct reference numbers.
