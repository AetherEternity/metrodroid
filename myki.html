            <h1>Farebot M: Myki (Victoria, AU)</h1>
            
            <p>Myki is the public transit ticket used in Victoria, Australia.  Farebot M implements support only for reading the card number from the card.</p>
            
            <p>Unfortunately, this card does not appear to have any freely readable data on the card which contains anything useful, like the balance or recent trips.</p>
            
            <p>The card technology is Mifare DESFire, which is currently resistant to a number of attacks which would allow the protected sectors to become readable.  Further developments may come, but there's no saying how long this will take.</p>
            
            <p>There are other applications available on the Google Play Store which claim to read your Myki.  They don't actually read the data from the card at all, apart from the card number.  They then use screen-scraping techniques to access the myki website in order to get this data.</p>
            
	    <p>The author of Farebot M doesn't think this is a reasonable way to "read" the card, because it involves talking to <abbr title="Public Transport Victoria">PTV</abbr>'s servers to be able to get extra information.  Every other reader implemented in Farebot M works totally offline, without talking any servers.</p>
            
	    <p>As a result, reading data from a Myki in the same way that other agencies allow is pretty much a dead end.  Unless significant changes are made by <abbr title="Public Transport Victoria">PTV</abbr>/Keane to the card format, Farebot M and other applications like it will not be able to implement offline reading functionality.</p>
            
	    <p><em>This doesn't make Myki more or less secure that other transit cards.</em></p>
            
            <p>Some other cards keys can be cracked, but this is only possible because they use older, less secure smartcard technology.  However, they have other security features in their system design which prevent fraud.</p>
            
	    <p>It is possible to publicly release specifications of your transit smartcard format and allow read access, and not have the system become less secure.  For example, HSL in Finland <a href="http://dev.hsl.fi/#travel-card">publicly document their smartcard format</a>, and Opal in Sydney allow limited read access to the card.</p>

	    <p>Without this, access to your Myki data effectively makes registration and personalisation of your card mandatory.  As a comparison, Transport for NSW does not require registration or internet access for Opal card data.</p>

	    <p>There is an opportunity for <abbr title="Public Transport Victoria">PTV</abbr> to embrace open data in a way that is secure, and to respect the privacy of it's citizens.</p>

	    <p>If you are a Victorian and want this sort of access to your Myki card, you should contact <a href="http://ptv.vic.gov.au/customer-service/feedback-and-complaints/">Public Transport Victoria</a> or the <a href="http://www.vic.gov.au/contactsandservices/directory/?ea0_lfz99_120.&amp;roleWithSubordinates&amp;d4594914-a7cc-4cfe-83c5-ca64af7fa031">Victorian Minister for Public Transport</a>.</p>
